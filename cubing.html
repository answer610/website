        <p class="intro">I have been a competitive Rubik's Cube speedsolver for 7 years now. I can solve the puzzle in 8 seconds on average. 
            I also speedsolve other cubes as small as 2x2 and as large as 7x7. I first started cubing in middle school and was hooked to
            it when I was first exposed to competitive solving and have been competing since then. Outside of competition, I have
            made many friends through cubing and find the community as a whole to be very welcoming to people from all sorts of backgrounds. 
            I now help organize and run cubing competitions as well as promote speedcubing through the Rubik's Cube Club at UC Berkeley. I even 
            co-facilitate a student-run course where we teach Berkeley students how to solve the Rubik's cube along with how group theory concepts
            can be applied to the cube.</p>
